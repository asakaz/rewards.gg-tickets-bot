  "body": "### Welcome to Rewards.GG Tickets Bot Official Download Page.\r\nThis bot is a very simple program that allows you to collect tickets on autopilot on Rewards.GG in a much more resource friendly and comfortable way.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nYou can find the download at the top of the page, which was hosted on my GitHub Page.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThe only file you need out of the archive that you download at the top of this page is the .**exe** (executable) file called: **Rewards.gg Tickets Bot.exe**.\r\n\r\nFirst you log into your Rewards.GG account. Right now in the beta version there is support for social media platforms.\r\n![](http://image.prntscr.com/image/7569795aad2043019dc158bed6bb27b5.png)\r\nYou can only reach the steam, facebook, google, twitter, and twitch logins-- this is currently a bug so you have to use those.\r\n\r\nThen next all you have to do is start the bot and minimize the program and check back later to check on your ticket count!\r\n\r\n###Extra information (mini wiki)\r\nIf you don't want to mute your whole computer's audio from the built in mute function in the application, open the volume mixer and mute as follows:\r\n![](http://image.prntscr.com/image/fd67d7dacfa5443893c152530a0a979a.png)\r\nThis will be built into the program in the future. This is only for if you want to use other audio while running the bot. \r\nSo now, the website that runs in the bot shouldn't be making any noise at all and you can use your computer freely.\r\n![](http://image.prntscr.com/image/98d42cb9860f452a8df6222fca723e52.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@asakaz - coding the whole project\r\nxZ3ROxPROJ3CTx - the visual basic theme (i used it to make the program look pretty)\r\nFreepik - the program icon \r\nAwesomium - the webbrowser/webcontrol i used to keep it stable so it could load flash elements\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nComing soon..\r\n",
