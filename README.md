Rewards.GG Tickets Bot / Coded in VB.Net
This bot is a very simple program that allows you to collect tickets on autopilot on Rewards.GG in a much more resource friendly and comfortable way.
It does not exploit or violate the rules of the website in any way.

First you log into your Rewards.GG account. Right now in the beta version there is support for social media platforms. 
You can only reach the steam, facebook, google, twitter, and twitch logins-- this is currently a bug so you have to use those.
Then next all you have to do is start the bot and minimize the program and check back later to check on your ticket count!

The login page is glitchy, you need to scroll down and use one of the social logins. 

If you don't want to mute your whole computer's audio from the built in mute function in the application, open the volume mixer and mute as follows:

This will be built into the program in the future. This is only for if you want to use other audio while running the bot. 

So now, the website that runs in the bot shouldn't be making any noise at all and you can use your computer freely.
